# Using Functions Inside Go Templates

Part 3 on An Introduction to Templates in Go series.

In this tutorial we are going to cover how to use template functions like `and`, `eq` and `index` to add some basic logic to our templates.

## `and` function
- The `and` function takes in two arguments, lets call them `a` and `b`, and then runs logic roughly equivalent to `if a then b else a`.
- `and` is a function and NOT a logic operation.
- The template package also provides an `or` function that operates much like `and` except it will short circuit when true, i.e., `if a then a else b`; here `b` is never evaluated if `a` is not empty.

## The comparison functions
- The `html/template` package provides us with a few classes to help carry out comparisons.
- These are:

>- `eq` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 == arg2`
>- `ne` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 != arg2`
>- `lt` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 < arg2`
>- `le` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 <= arg2`
>- `gt` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 > arg2`
>- `ge` - Returns the boolean truth of `arg1 >= arg2`

- These are used similarly to how `and` and `or` are used, where you first type the function and type the arguments. For example:

```HTML
{{if (ge .Usage .Limit)}}
    <p class="danger">
        You have reached your API usage limit. Please upgrade or contact support for more help.
    </p>
{{else if (gt .Usage .Warning)}}
    <p class="warning">
        You have use {{.Usage}} of {{.Limit}} API calls and are nearing your limit. Have you considered blah blah blah ...
    </p>
{{else if (eq .Usage 0)}}
    <p>
        You have not used the API yet. What are waiting for?
    </p>
{{else}}
    <p>
        You have used {{.Usage}} of {{.Limit}} API calls.
    </p>
{{end}}
```

## Using function variables
**1. Create a method on the `User` type**

This is the simplest - lets say you have a `User` type that we already provided to the view, we can just add a `HasPermission()` method to the object and then use that.

**2. Calling function variables and fields**

Imagine that for whatever reason that you can't the first approach because your method for determining logic needs to change at times. In this case it makes sense to creat a `HasPermission func(string) bool` attribute on the `User` type and assign it with a function.

When we assign functions to variables, we need to tell the `html/template` package that we want to call the function. Remember to add `call` right after the `if` statements like this:

```HTML
{{if (call .User.HasPermission "feature-a")}}

...

{{if (call .User.HasPermission "feature-b")}}

...

```

**Parenthesis can be used in templates**

While parenthesis aren't generally required in Go templates, they can be incredibly useful for making it clear which arguments need to be passed into which functions and specifying a clear order of operations.

**3. Creating custom functions with a `template.FuncMap`**

The final way of calling our own functions is creating custom functions with a `tmeplate.FuncMap`. This can be the most useful and powerful way to define functions because it allows us to create global helper methods that can be used throughout the app.

---
**Define functions before parsing templates**

In previous examples we were creating our template by calling the `template.ParseFiles` function provided by the `html/template` package. This is a package level function and returns a template after parsing the files. Now we are calling the ParseFiles method on the `template.Template` type, which has the same return values but applies the changes to the existing template (rather than a brand new one) and then returns the result.

In this situation we need to use the method because we need to define any plan to use in our templates, and once we do this with the template package it will return a `*template.Template`. After defining those custom functions we can then proceed to parse template that make use of the functions. If we were to first parse the templates you would see an error related to an undefined function being called in your template.

## Making our functions globally useful

The `hasPermission` function defined in the last section is great, but one problem with it is that we can only use it when we have access to the `User` object as well. Passing this around might not be too bad at first, but as the app grows it will end up having many templates and it is pretty easy to forget to pass the `User` object to a template, or to miss it on a nested template.

Our function would be much simpler if we could simplify it and only need to pass in a feature name.

The first thing we need to do is create a function for when no `User` is present. We will set this in the `template.FuncMap` before parsing our template so that we don't get parsing errors, and to make sure we have some logic in place in case the user is not available.

> :warning: **Potential race condition!**
> It should be noted here that if you don't clone the template **before** calling `Funcs` that you can potentially run into a race condition where multiple web requests are all trying to set different FuncMaps for the template. The final result could be that a user gets access to something they shouldn't have access to. This is possible for two reasons:
>
>1. Web requests are handled in goroutines by default, so your server will automatically be processing multiple requests at the same time.
>2. We are adding a `FuncMap` with a closure that uses the `user` variable. In previous examples we passed the user into the function so this race condition wasn't possible.
>
> This is pretty easy to fix with a `Clone`, but it might be worth nothing in your code not to remove the call to `Clone`.
